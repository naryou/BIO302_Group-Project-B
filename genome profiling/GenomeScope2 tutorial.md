# Running Meryl and GenomeScope2 on Galaxy

We will first use Meryl to create a K-mer database, then generate a histogram. This histogram is then used in GenomeScope2 for profiling analysis. Follow the 'Genome profile analysis' section in the VGP assembly pipeline [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/tutorials/vgp_genome_assembly/tutorial.html#genome-profile-analysis) 

As input sequences for Meryl, use the nanopore data (instead of HiFi_collection)
