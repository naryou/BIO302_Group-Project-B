# Pre-processing of Hi-C data using BWA-mem


# Running YaHS on Galaxy

From the Tools panel, choose [**YaHS** yet another HI-C scaffolding tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/yahs/yahs/1.2a.2+galaxy1)

Now in `Input contig sequences` provide the contig assembly (fasta file, output of the genome assembler) and in `Alignment file of Hi-C reads to contigs` provide the mapped and sorted Hi-C reads (bed file from last step) and run the tool.
