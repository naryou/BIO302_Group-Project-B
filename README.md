# Tutorial for BIO302_Group-Project-B

## On this [Galaxy history](), you find the following data:

- Whole  Genome Shotgun Sequencing of Primula grandis. This is Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp.
- Hi-C data. This is also Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp, but the read1 and read2 come from stretches of DNA which are in close distance in 3D. 
To refresh your knowledge on Hi-C data, please have a look at LEC2, NGS data generation and handling.


The project will be done in three steps:
- assembly using ABySS
- scaffolding using YaHS
- annotation using Repeat Modeler and Maker

You find the assembly tutorial [here](), scaffolding tutorial [here]() and annotation is [here]().
