# Tutorial for BIO302_Group-Project-B

*Students: Jeanine & Jan*

## On this [Galaxy history](), you find the following data

- Whole  Genome Shotgun Sequencing of Primula grandis. This is Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp.
- Nanopore reads of P. grandis
- Hi-C data. This is also Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp, but the read1 and read2 come from stretches of DNA which are in close distance in 3D. 
To refresh your knowledge on Hi-C data, please have a look at LEC2, NGS data generation and handling.
- Reference assembly of P. grandis generated using both long reads (Nanopore) and short reads (Illumina), which will be used for comparison with your *de novo* assembly

## The project will be done in four steps:
- genome profiling using GenomeScope2
- assembly using ABySS (for short reads) and Shasta (for long reads)
- scaffolding using YaHS
- annotation using Repeat Modeler (and Maker if we have time)

You find tutorials for genome profiling, assembly, scaffolding and annotation in this repository. Just navigate to different directories.
