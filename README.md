# Tutorial for BIO302_Group-Project-B

## On this [Galaxy history](), you find the following data

- Whole  Genome Shotgun Sequencing of Primula grandis. This is Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp.
- Hi-C data. This is also Illumina short reads, paired-end (PE), 150bp, but the read1 and read2 come from stretches of DNA which are in close distance in 3D. 
To refresh your knowledge on Hi-C data, please have a look at LEC2, NGS data generation and handling.
- Reference assembly of P. grandis generated using both long reads (Nanopore) and short reads (Illumina), which will be used for comparison with your de novo assembly

The project will be done in three steps:
- assembly using ABySS
- scaffolding using YaHS
- annotation using Repeat Modeler and Maker

You find the assembly tutorial [here](), scaffolding tutorial [here]() and annotation is [here]().
